Hotline Miami Template: A 2.5D topdown shooter template for the Unreal Engine 4
(C++, BP childclasses to set up components / properties)

Inspired by the famous game Hotline Miami.
Currently includes:
- Instant death / respawn
- Instant stage ("floor") reset & clean up
- Custom triggers for stage goals and stage switches
- Basic NPC / AI
- Basic weapon templates / classes (currently only raycast weapons, var. projectile & meele will follow)
- Physic doors (very important.)
